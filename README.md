# 🔒 AWS Compliance Dashboard

## 🚀 Overview
The AWS Compliance Dashboard is an automated security compliance monitoring system that fetches, analyzes, and visualizes security findings from AWS Security Hub. It ensures compliance with industry standards (e.g., FedRAMP, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, SOC 2, CIS Controls) and enforces remediation timelines based on risk severity.

This project demonstrates strong security leadership by implementing:
- Automated AWS Security Compliance Checks
- Real-time Risk Assessment & Dashboard Visualization
- FedRAMP-Aligned Remediation Timelines
- AWS Well-Architected Security Framework Best Practices
- Seamless Integration with GitHub Actions for Continuous Monitoring

🔥 **Why This Matters:**  
This repository eliminates **manual compliance tracking** and ensures **proactive security governance**—key responsibilities for a **Principal Security Compliance Lead**.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**
### ✅ **Automated Workflow**
1. **Fetch Security Findings from AWS Security Hub**  
   - Runs `fetch_compliance.py` to retrieve the latest security findings.  
   - Enforces compliance with security frameworks (FedRAMP, PCI DSS, etc.).
   - **Forces a structured severity format** to maintain report consistency.

2. **Apply Severity & Remediation Timelines**
   - Findings are categorized dynamically:
     - **First finding:** 🚨 **Critical**
     - **Next two findings:** ⚠️ **High**
     - **Next one finding:** 🟡 **Medium**
     - **Next two findings:** 🟢 **Low**
     - **Remaining findings:** ℹ️ **Informational**
   - **FedRAMP-aligned remediation deadlines**:
     - `Critical` → Immediate (24h)
     - `High` → 7 Days
     - `Medium` → 30 Days
     - `Low` → 90 Days
     - `Informational` → Best Effort

3. **Generate JSON Report (`compliance-report.json`)**
   - Stores security findings **with timestamps in AWS format** (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`).
   - Ensures **auditability and historical tracking**.

4. **Update & Display Findings in the Compliance Dashboard**
   - The **`index.html`** file dynamically fetches `compliance-report.json`.
   - Displays a **real-time compliance dashboard** with:
     - **Security Findings by Severity**
     - **Remediation Timelines**
     - **AWS Service Affected**
     - **Compliance Standards**
     - **Date First Discovered** (AWS timestamp)
